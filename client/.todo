Notes:
  ☐ In styling we make container around the container to be --> one container for the background and one container for the content -- so we can style them sepaprately
  ☐ :root selector  -- place-items & place-content properties
  ☐ [name]  --> to put a variable as a property name or a value inside an object you have to use []square brackets
  ☐ instead of using multiple useStates --> use single object contains the states and pass options to the handler function that changes the states to define which state needs to changes
  ☐ but how to pass arguments to the handler function without running it --> becuase if you tried hadlerFunc('name',20) this will run it and cause infinite loop if it changes a state --> so we have to pass arrow func as a handler func and inside it you can call the true handler you want and pass the values
  ☐ disabled attribute in button element --> shorthand used for disable the button clicks under certain conditions
  ☐ overflow: hidden; --> set to a container to hide overflow of elments inside a container
  ☐ to make an overflowed image shrink and takes the targeted width --> use widht:100%;
  ☐ to devide tracks into relative sizes like grid but using flex box --> go to each element and use flex:1 or flex:3
  ☐  const navigate = useNavigate();
      navigate('/hotel', {state:{destination, date, options}})  --> we can pass state to the navigation
      then const  location = useLocation() accepts that path and the state object
  ☐ {type} instead of using passing props then take type from it --> props.type
  ☐ remember to take input form input element use onChange event 


NOTES:
  ☐ inline style in react have to be object --> style={{color:"grean"}}
